PaintFX v1.0


New features:
* Open Image
* Save Image
* Save as
* menu bar
* .jpg, .png, .bmp support and conversion

Known issues:

* Not on GitHub

Expected next sprint:

* draw a line (which would become part of the saved image / save an image with those edits)

* manage an image larger than the window and the screen (up to you how to do this)

* allow you to control the width of the line drawn

* have a color chooser (it is NOT required to impact the line, yet)

* have a help menu item with help and about options; about should be a separate window.
